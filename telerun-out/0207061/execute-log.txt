Small scale tests (on scene 'DoubleSlitSmallScale'):
  CPU sequential implementation:
    run time: 418.76 ms

  GPU naive implementation:
    run time: 2.35 ms
    correctness: 8.50e-06 relative RMSE

  GPU shared memory implementation:
    run time: 0.02 ms
    correctness: 1.00e+00 relative RMSE

  CPU -> GPU naive speedup: 177.98x

Large scale tests (on scene 'DoubleSlit'):
  GPU naive implementation:
    run time: 5265.31 ms

  Skipping GPU shared memory implementation (incorrect)
  GPU naive -> GPU shared memory speedup: N/A (incorrect)
